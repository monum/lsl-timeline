# lsl-timeline
This is an experimental timeline-based blog for the Local Sense Lab, a pilot "Smart City" project facilitated by the City of Boston. We intend to use this blog to document the Lab's work and learnings.

The vertical timeline script comes from [Codyhouse](https://codyhouse.co/gem/vertical-timeline/).
